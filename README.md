# 99Tech Code Challenge #1  

## Problem 1: Sum Calculation Approaches  

In this problem, I implemented three different methods to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to *n*:  

1. **Looping from 1 to *n***  
   - **Time Complexity:** 𝑂(𝑛)  
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

2. **Using the *n*-th triangular number formula (Recommended)**  
   - **Time Complexity:** 𝑂(1)  
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

3. **Using Recursion**  
   - **Time Complexity:** 𝑂(𝑛)  
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n)  

## Problem 2: Areas for Improvement  

Due to time constraints, there are some areas that could be further optimized:  

- **Dropdown search functionality**: Implementing a search feature to filter currencies dynamically.  
- **API factory pattern**: Improving code structure by centralizing API calls for better maintainability.  
- **State management setup (e.g., Redux)**: Useful for managing complex state in larger applications.
